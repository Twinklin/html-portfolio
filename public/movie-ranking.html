<h1>The Best Movies According to Ananya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
    This is my favourite movie.<br />
    This is a family movie that'll take you on a rollercoaster of emotions like you'll laugh a lot, cry a lot<br />
    & in general at last just feel very good/content after finishing it.
</p>
<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>It's a slow anime movie that'll make you cry your eyes out.</p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>
    It's actually has 3 volumes/movies.<br />
    I personally love the whole series of Avengers & in this Groot was my favorite.<br />
    He's just too Cutee.
